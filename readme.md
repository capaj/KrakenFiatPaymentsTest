# Kraken coding test for backend engineer

## How to run

Just `docker-compose up`.

## Why did I choose MikroORM?

This could have been implemented without an ORM or with objection/prisma/typeorm and myriads of others.
I've never worked with MikroORM and if I am going to spend time writing code just to show I know how to code, then I might as well try out a new ORM while I am at it.

## What did I think about mikroORM?

It seems like a solid, especially if you're coming from the likes of doctrine
